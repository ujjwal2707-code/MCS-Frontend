**System Requirements Specification (SRS)**

**1. Introduction**

This document specifies the system requirements for the Mobile Cyber Security (MCS) application. It details the functional and non-functional requirements, as well as the system's hardware, software, and network interfaces.

**2. System Overview**

The MCS application is a mobile client-server application. The client is a React Native application for Android and iOS, and the server is a backend service that provides the core functionality through a REST API.

**3. Functional Requirements**

The functional requirements are detailed in the Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) document.

**4. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **4.1. Performance:**
    *   The application shall have a startup time of less than 3 seconds.
    *   API response times shall be less than 2 seconds for all requests.
    *   The application shall be able to handle a minimum of 100 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
*   **4.2. Scalability:**
    *   The backend infrastructure shall be scalable to handle an increasing number of users and requests.
*   **4.3. Availability:**
    *   The backend services shall have an uptime of 99.9%.
*   **4.4. Security:**
    *   All communication between the client and server shall be encrypted using HTTPS.
    *   User passwords shall be hashed and salted before being stored in the database.
    *   The application shall be protected against common security vulnerabilities, such as those listed in the OWASP Mobile Top 10.
*   **4.5. Usability:**
    *   The application shall have a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
    *   The application shall be accessible to users with disabilities.
*   **4.6. Reliability:**
    *   The application shall be reliable and not crash or hang frequently.
*   **4.7. Maintainability:**
    *   The code shall be well-documented and easy to maintain.
*   **4.8. Portability:**
    *   The application shall be portable to different versions of Android and iOS with minimal changes.

**5. System Interfaces**

*   **5.1. Hardware Interfaces:**
    *   The application shall be compatible with standard smartphone hardware, including cameras (for QR code scanning) and network interfaces (Wi-Fi, cellular).
*   **5.2. Software Interfaces:**
    *   **5.2.1. Operating System:** The application shall be compatible with Android 8.0 (Oreo) and above, and iOS 13 and above.
    *   **5.2.2. Backend API:** The application shall communicate with the backend server through a REST API. The API endpoints are defined as follows:
        *   `POST /account/register`: Register a new user.
        *   `POST /account/login`: Log in a user.
        *   `POST /account/verify`: Verify a user's email.
        *   `POST /account/resend`: Resend the verification OTP.
        *   `POST /account/forget`: Initiate the password recovery process.
        *   `POST /account/change`: Change a user's password.
        *   `GET /account/profile`: Get the user's profile information.
        *   `POST /url`: Scan a URL for threats.
        *   `POST /domain-reputation`: Check the reputation of a domain.
        *   `POST /breach`: Check for data breaches associated with an email address.
        *   `GET /cyber-news`: Fetch the latest cybersecurity news.
*   **5.3. Communications Interfaces:**
    *   The application shall use the HTTPS protocol for all communication with the backend server.

**6. System Architecture**

*   **6.1. Client-Side Architecture:**
    *   The client-side application is built using the React Native framework.
    *   It uses the following key libraries:
        *   `@react-navigation/native`: For navigation between screens.
        *   `@tanstack/react-query`: For managing server state.
        *   `axios`: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
        *   `react-native-paper`: For UI components.
        *   `react-native-vision-camera`: For QR code scanning.
*   **6.2. Server-Side Architecture:**
    *   The server-side application is a RESTful API that provides the core functionality of the application.
    *   The server-side technology stack is not specified in the provided code, but it is responsible for handling user authentication, data storage, and the business logic for the security features.
